     <h4>OUR STORY </h4>
    <p>Towards the end of 2016, our eyes were opened to the many difficulties faced by migrants and refugees as they pursue a new life in Lisbon. As we deepened our friendships with people from all over the globe, we began to witness the struggles and barriers that prevent migrants and refugees from successfully integrating in our city. More than anything, we felt there was a need for place where people could be heard, where their names could be known and where they could belong. <br>

        â€‹As 2017 came around we started doing our research. We started making new friends and listening to more stories. We started meeting and partnering with other likeminded people with whom we could collaborate with in order to pursue change where change was needed. A couple months later we found our home and in June 2017 we officially moved in. The Lisbon Project is the outcome of a few friends who saw a problem and took action to become part of the solution.</br>
           
 In 2019 we had outgrown our first home and moved to a bigger, more central head office in Alameda! Here we could welcome more people, meet more needs and serve with more excellence. Our network of partners has also increased and as a result we can create more impact collectively! We continue to mobilize hearts and lives so that the hurting and the neglected may be empowered to restore a better future, a future where they belong in a great big family called the Lisbon Project!
